	<h1 class="smoothboxh">Conclusion</h1>
	<p class="smoothbox">Research into lifestyle choices and habits, widened our perspective of health related statistics based on the sample size of 66 individuals. When we compared the values of exercise done weekly vs sitting down on a spectrum of 0-20+ hours, an interesting trend could be visualised. ”Exercise Weekly” was positively skewed, whereas “Hours Sitting Down” had a symmetrical distribution. This particular finding allows us to conclude, based on the data collected that weekly exercise averages 4-5 hours. Sitting down daily is 8-9 hours. This ratio of 59.5:4.5 “Weekly Sitting Down” to ”Weekly Exercise” respectively infers the percentages 8.3% and 91.7%. This vital piece of data tells us that averagely, people tend to sit down 10 times the amount they exercise. These values were expected as they correlate to the world health organisation guidelines, which recommend around 4 hours of moderate intensity exercise weekly.
	<br>Within our second comparison graph, "Average weights of boys and girls surveyed (16)", data was filtered for those who had inputted their age as 16. No other ages were investigated due to small sample sizes. Upon inspection of the two line graphs, it is immediately clear that the female weights were more positively skewed, whilst males are negatively skewed. This outcome is reasonable and expected; according to global averages, males generally weigh 12% more than females. Similarly, this secondary source data of global averages, can allow us to determine the health of the individuals surveyed. The results determined for males were unexpected as there was a 15% greater average weight than globally recognised. When looked deeper, This may be directly correlated to another detail found from the survey: “Healthy Eating”. Only 49% of respondents rated their diet as healthy, deducing that the other 51% possibly make bad dietary decisions, ultimately leading to larger weights.</p>
	<p class="smoothbox">Lastly we analysed what people did most while sitting down. 55% said they were studying, 6% worked, 22% Spent their time on entertainment and 17% other. The pie chart depicts that studying was the dominant category. Upon further investigation, this particular statistic can be explained by the limitation of data collation mostly only coming from classmates. This caused bias toward the specific age group, 16 year olds. This possible fault in data collection led to similarly biased results that mostly reflected a lifestyle of students in senior school. Ultimately, this justifies why work was the least common activity when sitting down, whilst studying is the highest.
	Based on the pros of a proactive lifestyle vs the cons of a sedentary lifestyle, it is clear that the pursuit of better health is extremely important. Through conducting this survey, the links between key points in lifestyle and one’s body health show strong correlation. It is only by ensuring a healthy diet, enough exercise and balancing all areas </p>
