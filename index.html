				This website was made to educate people about lifestyle choices.
				A lifestyle is the way a person lives, and it can be associated with everything you do, whether it is the way you wash your clothes or the way you travel to school. 
				In this website we will be investigating two polar lifestyles, a pro-active lifestyle and a sedentary lifestyle, further elaborating on why lifestyle choices are so 
				important. Everyone's lifestyle is different, so we need to find the best lifestyle choices for ourselves.</p>
			<p class="smoothbox">Sedentary lifestyle: An increasingly widespread lifestyle stereotyped by their tendency to not reach the recommended 150 minutes of weekly exercise. This category of people pursues little to no physical activity throughout their daily lives. Studies show that a prolonged sedentary lifestyle can increase chances of obesity, type 2 diabetes, types of cancer, cardiovascular disease and possibility of an early death.</p>

			<p class="smoothbox">
				1. Staying in a stationary position for most of the hours that a person is awake, this could be due to work, school or just generally for entertainment purposes (gaming, binging tv-shows, hobbies)<br>
				2. This lifestyle is also associated with those who consume unhealthy food, these foods are most commonly referred to as “junk food"<br>
				3. Most importantly not participating in any physical activity, whether this would be going out to exercise or just not being active/not moving in general<br>
				4. An addiction to smoking, consumption of alcohol, drugs, etc
