            <h1>OUR PROJECT PROPOSAL</h1>
			<h2><div id = "introduction" class="smoothboxh">Proposed Topic Questions:</div></h2>
			<h3 class="smoothboxh">What is your chosen infographic topic and why is this a topic you wish to research?
			</h3>
			<p class="smoothbox">
				Our chosen topic is obesity and this topic was chosen to inform the public and spread awareness about the dangers of obesity. Our infographic will explore what obesity is, what causes obesity, why the rates are increasing, what we can do individually to avoid obesity and what are some overall strategies that can combat obesity rates.
				<br>
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3 class="smoothboxh">Purpose of the infographic website – Persuade, Inform or Entertain? What does it aim to achieve?
			</h3>
			<p class="smoothbox">
				To inform people about obesity and it’s danger and to further persuade them to adopt a healthier lifestyle that will combat obesity.
			</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="smoothboxh">Intended audience – Describe the type of students this infographic is targeted towards and why, eg age group, ethnicity, gender, interests, etc
				</h3>
				<p class="smoothbox">
					Our infographic is targeted towards the general public to inform those who may be making unhealthy choices or it’s there to further encourage and support those who are living healthier lifestyles.
				</p>
				<br>
					<h3 class="smoothboxh">What information based on secondary data are you aiming to research and present on your website?
					</h3>
					<p class="smoothbox">
						Information about international obesity statistics, the nutritional values of commonly eaten foods and what we can do to combat obesity.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3 class="smoothboxh">What will you do to ensure the integrity of your primary and secondary data (i.e reliable and free from bias)?
					</h3>
					<p class="smoothbox">
						Using multiple reputable sources and comparing them to eliminate most of the bias
	Obtain data from a wider variety of people/sources 
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3 class="smoothboxh">What will you do to ensure the ethical collection, storage and use of primary collected data?
					</h3>
					<p class="smoothbox">
						We would make sure to ask for consent and clearly state our use of the data we are collecting. The data we are collecting will be stored in a local drive until the SAC is completed. When actually using the data, the information will be broadened and anonymous
					</p>
					<br>
				<h3 class="smoothboxh">Amendments</h3>
				<p class="smoothbox">
					Due to certain restrictions on our previous topic, we had shifted from effects of obesity to effects of an unhealthy lifestyle. We believed that our new topic was more broad and that we had more ideas to explore in relation to lifestyle choices.

This new research idea allowed us to more deeply investigate the causes and impacts of sedentary lifestyles and why people should switch to a proactive lifestyle. We have researched both the features of a sedentary lifestyle and proactive lifestyle, looking at pros and cons of both. Furthermore we also highlighted how and why to make both lifestyles more healthy and lower the risk of illnesses and health issues stemming from bad lifestyle choices.
